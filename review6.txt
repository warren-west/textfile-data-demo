If you want a cheap guitar that plays like a dream, your search is over. It came brand new in the box, plastic peels intact. The quality is top notch, and it’s gorgeous! Right out of the box it plays super smooth. My only issue is the neck being a little thick, but that’s just a personal preference thing. Ive been playing 15 years and would highly recommend this to anyone, new people especially since the price is right.
