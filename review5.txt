No complaints about the craftsmanship or the guitar itself, other than the volume knob is a bit sticky and harder to turn than the tone knob. But the big issue is that it came missing the whammy bar. I’ve contacted Amazon and they got back to me and said that they would contact the manufacturer. That was two months ago. Nothing has happened. Oh well, I guess I’ll just deal with it. Thanks
